# Whitebox - Machine learning monitoring

## What is Whitebox?

Whitebox is an open source E2E ML monitoring platform with edge capabilities that plays nicely with kubernetes.

## Why use Whitebox?

- Deploying a machine learning model in production is not the end of the lifecycle. You need data to iterate and improve.
- Solve data privacy by monitoring data at the edge and only return aggregated data for reporting and alerting.
