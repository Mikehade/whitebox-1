## Classification Models Metrics

Whitebox includes comprehensive metrics tracking for classification models. These metrics include

- accuracy
- precision
- recall
- F1 score
- confusion matrix

This allows users to easily evaluate the performance of their classification models and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, users can set custom thresholds for each metric to receive alerts when performance deviates from expected results.

## Regression Models Metrics

Whitebox includes comprehensive metrics tracking for regression models. These metrics include

- mean squared error
- mean absolute error
- R-squared,

This allows users to easily evaluate the performance of their regression models and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, users can set custom thresholds for each metric to receive alerts when performance deviates from expected results.

## Data / Model Drift Monitoring

Whitebox includes monitoring for data and model drift. This feature tracks changes in the distribution of the data used to train models and alerts users when significant changes occur. Additionally, it detects changes in the performance of deployed models and alerts users when significant drift is detected. This allows users to identify and address data and model drift early, reducing the risk of poor model performance.

## Alerts

Whitebox includes an alerting system that allows users to set custom thresholds for metrics and receive notifications when performance deviates from expected results. These alerts can be delivered via email, SMS, or webhook, and can be customized to fit the needs of any organization. This allows users to quickly respond to changes in model performance and take action to improve results.
